  <h3>☕ The Roots of the Bean</h3>
  <p>
    According to legend, coffee was discovered in Ethiopia by a goat herder named Kaldi. His goats became unusually energetic after eating bright red berries — the world’s first recorded coffee buzz.
  </p>
  <p>
    The beans made their way through the Arabian Peninsula, where the first coffee houses called "qahveh khaneh" became hubs of conversation, chess, music, and learning.
